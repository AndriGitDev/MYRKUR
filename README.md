## 👋 What's This All About?

Hey there! MYRKUR (Icelandic for "darkness," fitting, right?) is a personal project I'm building to visualize simulated cyberattacks targeting Iceland. The idea is to create a dynamic and engaging map that shows where (simulated) attacks are coming from, what types of attacks they are, and get a general overview of the (again, simulated) cyber threat landscape.

It's all for fun and learning, using a mix of JavaScript for the simulation and Leaflet.js to bring the map to life. All the data you see is **simulated** based on internet averages and general knowledge – no real attacks here!

## ✨ Cool Features So Far

This has been a fun journey, and here's what MYRKUR can do right now:

* **🌍 Live(ish) Map**: A dark mode map centered on Iceland, looking all cool and cyber-y.
* **🎯 Targeted Attacks**: Simulated attacks primarily hitting Reykjavik and occasionally Akureyri.
* **🏹 Attack Vectors**: Visual lines on the map show attacks flying in from various (simulated) source countries. These lines are color-coded based on the attack's severity.
* **📜 Recent Attacks Feed**: A scrolling list on the side gives you the deets on recent simulated incidents.
* **📊 Overview Dashboard**: A fixed section at the bottom shows:
    * **Attack Type Stats**: Nifty circles for each major attack type, showing the total count and when the last one of that kind (fictionally) occurred.
    * **Attacker Country Leaderboard**: A two-column list showing which (simulated) countries are launching the most attacks, sorted by count.
    * **Overall Last Attack**: A quick look at when the very last simulated event happened.
* **🕶️ Sleek UI**:
    * A custom header with the project name "MYRKUR", my name (Andri Petur Hafthorsson), and links to my website and LinkedIn.
    * A "CyberAttack Simulator" title overlaid on the map.
* **❗ Disclaimer First**: A pop-up disclaimer to make sure everyone knows this is all simulated data for educational and illustrative purposes.

## 🛠️ Tech Bits

This project is primarily built with:

* **HTML**: For the basic structure.
* **CSS**: For making it look good (hopefully!).
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**: For all the simulation logic, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.
* **Leaflet.js**: For the interactive map and drawing attack lines.
* **CartoDB Dark Matter Tiles**: For the awesome dark mode map background.

## ✍️ A Note from the Developer

This is a personal project I'm tinkering with to practice my coding and explore data visualization. The name "MYRKUR" is a nod to the often shadowy nature of cybersecurity.

Again, all data is **simulated**.

Thanks for checking it out!
